# AhoCorasick
In computer science, the Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick.
It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text. It's based on a **Trie Tree** which is a dictonary tree.
